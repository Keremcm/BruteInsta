## 1. Create Password List (Wordlist)

- With Create_Password.py, run the code by entering information related to the target with the account password. This file creates tens of thousands of passwords for the target.
- To create possible passwords '!', '?', '@', '-', '_'.
- Tens of thousands of passwords are saved to the 'Wordlist.txt' file.


## 2. BruteForce

- Tens of thousands of passwords in 'Wordlist.txt' try the passwords in seconds using the algorithm in the module.
- The number of trials gives information such as correct passwords (supporting more than one password verification).
- Records the password/passwords towards the 'account name.txt' file


## 3. Enjoy!

Remember, this is not a legal activity! Educational purposes, good fun.
